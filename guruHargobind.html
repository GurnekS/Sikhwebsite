							<h4>The 6th Sikh Guru was Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji. He was born on June 19, 1595, and became
								the Guru of the Sikh community at a young age after the shaheedi of his father, Guru
								Arjan Dev Ji. Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji played a crucial role in shaping Sikhism during a
								challenging period marked by religious persecution. Unlike his predecessors, Guru Hargobind
								Sahib Ji was not only a spiritual leader but also a warrior. He introduced the concept
								of the Miri-Piri, emphasizing the harmonious integration of spiritual and temporal
								aspects of life. This philosophy encouraged Sikhs to be both spiritually enlightened
								and physically capable. Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji is particularly known for constructing
								the Akal Takht, the Throne of the Almighty, at the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar.
								This symbolized the temporal authority of the Sikhs and became a center for both
								spiritual guidance and dispute resolution. During his tenure, Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji
								also organized the Sikh community into a military force to protect themselves from
								external threats. He led the Sikhs in battles against oppressive rulers while promoting
								self-defense and the protection of religious freedom. Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji served as
								the Guru from 1606 until his passing in 1644. His leadership marked a transformative
								period for Sikhism, shaping its identity as a martial and spiritually resilient
								community.</h4>
