							<h4>Guru Arjan Dev Ji, the fifth Sikh Guru, endured five days of torture without shedding a
								drop of blood. Born on April 14, 1563, in Goindwal, he was the son of Guru Ram Das Ji
								and Bibi Bhani Ji. Recognized for his spiritual qualities early on, Guru Arjan Dev Ji was
								chosen as the Guru after demonstrating a balance of Naam, Seva, and community engagement.
								His marriage to Mata Ganga Ji resulted in the birth of Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji. Guru
								Arjan Dev Ji played a key role in completing the construction of the Amritsar Sarovar
								and expanded the city of Amritsar. He chose a Muslim, Hazrat Mian Mir, to lay the
								foundation stone of Harmandir Sahib, emphasizing religious tolerance. To combat the
								distortion of Sikh teachings by Prithi Chand, Guru Arjan Dev Ji compiled the Adi Granth,
								organizing it by Raag. The Adi Granth was later developed into Guru Granth Sahib, with
								nearly half of its shabads written by Guru Arjan Dev Ji. In 1605, Jahangir's ascent to
								the throne marked a turning point. False accusations led to Guru Arjan Dev Ji's arrest
								and subsequent torture. Despite enduring immense suffering, Guru Ji remained calm,
								reciting Naam and Shabads. On May 25, 1606, Guru Arjan Dev Ji became the first Guru to
								become shaheed, setting a powerful precedent for Sikhi. He also gave a bachan(command)
								to his son Guru Hargobind sahib that the Sikhs will have to take up arms to defend
								themselves and the defenseless.</h4>
